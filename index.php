<h2 class="mt-0">A warm welcome to you all!</h2>

<p> The National Conference Committee is excited to be bringing the Australian Music Therapy Association’s 2020 National Conference to you… from the comfort of your own home! As the year progresses, we feel that our central theme of “Connection” seems to constantly deepen in experience and meaning... and so, we look forward to dialoguing, learning and collaborating with you.</p>
<p>This website is the central point of information sharing for the 2020 AMTA National Conference. In the lead up to this on-line conference, we will be updating the content as plans are finalised. Over the next few months, we will be sharing more information about the accessibility of the conference, the exciting content, and the innovative ways that YOU can get involved.</p>
<p>In the meantime, please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions or collaborative thoughts. We look forward to virtually welcoming you all in November!</p>

<p>Be well,</p>

<h3>Tanya Marie Silveira</h3>
<p><strong>On behalf of the National Conference Committee</strong></p>
