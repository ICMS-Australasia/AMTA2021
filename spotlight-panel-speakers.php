<p>Throughout history, Southeast Asia has been a melting pot of cultures, religions, food heritages, along with spiritual, healing, and music traditions. The few qualified SEA music therapists face unique opportunities and challenges as they juggle numerous professional plates. This special platform will bring together unique perspectives of how music therapists are bridging larger intersectional themes of healing, amplifying indigenous music roots, and advocating for the profession within their own east-west situatedness in clinical practice, across the intersections of Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Singapore.</p>

<h2>The Evolving Symphonies of Life: Conducting Music Therapy in Cancer and Palliative Care across the Lifespan</h2>

<p>Being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness is life-changing for the individual and their family. Music therapy can do much in this space, integrating moments of peace and comfort into treatment and care, amplifying voices of stability and familiarity, strengthening bonds and connection, and transforming experiences of fear and sadness into moments of joy and fun. The Panel will explore how music therapy can amplify and evolve the resilience and strengths of the patient and family, support wellbeing and living fully, facilitate moments of sharing and support, and provide enduring legacies.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">Brian will discuss using Amplified Cardio-Pulmonary Recording with Adult Oncology Patients. The intervention consists of recording the patient’s heart/lungs, then combining it with either original or pre-recorded music that has special meaning for the patient and their family. This intervention technique results in a recording that the patient and family can use to maintain connection. Amplified Cardio-Pulmonary Recordings (ACPR) accentuate the potential for life rhythms and meaningful melodies that highlight direct or subtle aspects of a lived experience through preservation of vital sounds and live and recorded music.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">The Paediatric Palliative Care (PPC) service is often viewed with fear and apprehension given the common misconception that a referral to PPC signifies ‘giving up’ on a child and their treatment. Instead, PPC clinicians work alongside treating medical teams to enhance the quality of life of the child with a life-limiting condition and their family. Music therapy plays an important role in providing holistic care that promotes well-being, and helps a child to live their best life. This presentation will chronicle the journey of a PPC patient and family thus far, demonstrating how music therapy, in conjunction with other PPC allied health disciplines, continues to provide opportunities for growth, self-expression, and enjoyment, even during a pandemic.</p>

<h2>Amplifying the Voices of Older Adults and their Carers in Music Therapy</h2>

<p>Globally, the number of older persons is growing faster than the number of people in any other age group. Older adults face changing healthcare needs, as well as changing social roles, responsibilities and relationships. The carers of older adults also represent a diverse and growing group, with their own unique needs and roles. The Panel will explore how music therapy can give voice to and support the evolving needs of older adults and their carers, helping them to live and age well; enhancing quality of life; and enabling them to create, connect, learn and grow through ageing.</p>
