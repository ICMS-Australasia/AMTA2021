<h2>Voices of South-East Asian Music Therapy</h2>

<p>Throughout history, Southeast Asia has been a melting pot of cultures, religions, food heritages, along with spiritual, healing, and music traditions. The few qualified SEA music therapists face unique opportunities and challenges as they juggle numerous professional plates. This special platform will bring together unique perspectives of how music therapists are bridging larger intersectional themes of healing, amplifying indigenous music roots, and advocating for the profession within their own east-west situatedness in clinical practice, across the intersections of Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Singapore.</p>

<h2>The Evolving Symphonies of Life: Conducting Music Therapy in Cancer and Palliative Care across the Lifespan</h2>

<p>Being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness is life-changing for the individual and their family. Music therapy can do much in this space, integrating moments of peace and comfort into treatment and care, amplifying voices of stability and familiarity, strengthening bonds and connection, and transforming experiences of fear and sadness into moments of joy and fun. The Panel will explore how music therapy can amplify and evolve the resilience and strengths of the patient and family, support wellbeing and living fully, facilitate moments of sharing and support, and provide enduring legacies. </p>
