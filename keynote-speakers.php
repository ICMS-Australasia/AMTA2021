<h2 class="mb-0">Dr Melissa Murphy</h2>
<h3 class="mt-0">Dr Melissa Murphy will speak on music and music therapy in the disability sector; the current state of play and a bright future led by the raised voices of the disability community.</h3>
<p class="mt-4">Dr Melissa Murphy, PhD, RMT is a music therapy practitioner, supervisor, educator and researcher. Since the early 1990s she has worked in mental health, aged and palliative care, but her primary interest lies in the disability sector. She currently works with both children and adults with disability in the education system, community settings and in private practice drawing on her skills as a clinical music therapist, GIM practitioner and community music therapist.  Her passion is in working with adolescents and young people with disability to ensure equal access to music, whether that is music for health and well-being, community music, music education or vocational pathways. She is the founder of MusicSpace, a community music hub for people living in the greater Geelong and Surf coast regions. Philosophically informed by critical and ecological theory, MusicSpace aims to foster personal and group creativity, as well as social and musical connections within the local community. She is the former National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) representative and Disability Advisor for AMTA including the music therapy representative for the NDIS working group of Allied Health Professions Australia (AHPA).</p>
<h5>About the Presentation:</h5>
<p>Throughout her career, Melissa has seen great changes evolve for people within the disability community and this has given hope for the future. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is based on sound principles of social justice, drawn from the United National Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability. Its economic modelling was first generated in the 1970’s together with the national health insurance bill, Medibank. Although challenges have beset the NDIS and its participants, the impetus that launched this initiative in 2013 has opened the door to a tide of loud and proud voices within and around the disability community. As we have now seen, these voices can no longer be set aside or ignored. The future for music therapy within the scheme looks strong. Having been included from the beginning as an allied health service by the NDIA, demand for music therapy has continued to grow and this growth is driven by participants. Salient questions are now emerging about the positioning of our profession within the scheme and disability work more broadly. How should music therapists engage with contemporary cultural understandings of disability whilst working within the bounds of a state-run system? Drawing on critical disability studies, Melissa will explore some of these questions through the example of a community music program alongside her own growth as a disability ally and music therapist.</p>

<h2 class="mb-0">Dr Sue Baines</h2>
<h3 class="mt-0">Dr Sue Baines will discuss anti-oppressive music therapy: the foundations and the practice.</h3>
<p class="mt-4">Dr Sue Baines, MTA, FAMI is a music therapy scholar/educator/practitioner and social justice activist. Because of her interest in how music is helpful for our human family, over the past three decades, she has worked with people of all ages in many settings, from youth corrections to long term care to in-patient and forensic psychiatry to at-risk children to community mental health. Her social justice focus has shaped her practice and research, first feminist music therapy in her master’s work, followed by community music therapy research, leading up to anti-oppressive music therapy. Since 1995, Sue has been a field supervisor for music therapy practicum students and since 1997, Sue has taught undergraduate music therapy students at Capilano University in North Vancouver, BC, Canada. Her combination of music therapy scholar/educator/practitioner keeps her research and teaching grounded in practice. Furthering her goal of social justice, Sue has authored many articles, chapters, and book reviews interrogating and contextualizing music therapy with the goal of ending systemic oppression in our field. She has been a member of both the Canadian Association of Music Therapists and Music Therapy Association of British Columbia boards and is past Editor-in-Chief of the Canadian Journal of Music Therapy. </p>
<h5>About the Presentation:</h5>
<p>Sue will discuss her theoretical underpinnings of Anti-Oppressive Music Therapy (AOMT) (S. Baines, 2013 & 2021), being Feminism and Feminist Therapy (Brown, 2008), Community Music Therapy (S. Baines, 2000/03), Anti-Oppressive Practice (D. Baines, 2017), and Anti-Oppressive Pedagogy (Friere, 1970). AOMT is needed to address music therapy’s overt and covert participation in systemic oppression. AOMT is a general theory and practice that links critical music therapy theories and practices such as Queer Music Therapy (Bain, et al., 2016), Feminist Music Therapy (Curtis, 2019), and Post-Ableist Music Therapy (Shaw, 2019).</p>
<p>To critically reflect on your internalization and participation in systemic oppression, ask yourself these types of questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Who taught me my stories about people who are different from me and my family of origin?</li>
  <li>What was I taught to believe about those differences?</li>
  <li>Who benefits from these stories that were taught to me?</li>
</ol>
<p>Integrating an AOMT framework will result in music therapy being a partner in ending systemic oppression and creating a more socially just future.</p>
