<h3 class="mt-0">Dr Sue Baines will discuss anti-oppressive music therapy: the foundations and the practice.</h3>
<p class="mt-4">Dr Sue Baines, MTA, FAMI is a music therapy scholar/educator/practitioner and social justice activist. Because of her interest in how music is helpful for our human family, over the past three decades, she has worked with people of all ages in many settings, from youth corrections to long term care to in-patient and forensic psychiatry to at-risk children to community mental health. Her social justice focus has shaped her practice and research, first feminist music therapy in her masterâ€™s work, followed by community music therapy research, leading up to anti-oppressive music therapy. Since 1995, Sue has been a field supervisor for music therapy practicum students and since 1997, Sue has taught undergraduate music therapy students at Capilano University in North Vancouver, BC, Canada. Her combination of music therapy scholar/educator/practitioner keeps her research and teaching grounded in practice. Furthering her goal of social justice, Sue has authored many articles, chapters, and book reviews interrogating and contextualizing music therapy with the goal of ending systemic oppression in our field. She has been a member of both the Canadian Association of Music Therapists and Music Therapy Association of British Columbia boards and is past Editor-in-Chief of the Canadian Journal of Music Therapy. </p>
