<h2 class="d-inline">Dr Marisol Norris</h2>
<h3 class="d-inline">presents ‘Building connections: Radical imaginations in music therapy’</h3>
<p class="mt-4">Dr. Marisol S. Norris is a board-certified music therapist, critical arts therapies educator, speaker, consultant, and founder of the Black Music Therapy Network, Inc. Her clinical and supervisory experience has spanned medical and community health settings and includes work with adult psychiatric and dually diagnosed populations, adolescents facing homelessness, families within the city court system, and medically fragile children with a history of complex trauma. These experiences have profoundly contributed to her relational-cultural lens of music therapy theory and praxis and her dedication to expanding the understanding of Black clients’ aesthetics across disciplines. She's published on culturally sustaining practice and vocal music therapy with Black clients from limited-resource communities. Her doctoral research is among the first in music therapy to detail Black client aesthetic meaning-making within a group context and in healthcare to explore Black clients’ experiences from a critical aesthetic lens. As a result, her work informs not only the music therapy community but further contributes to the growing knowledge of culturally responsive clinical practice within the arts therapies, counselling, related health disciplines and the collective discourse of Black bodies within cultural aesthetics, semiotic anthropology, and Africana studies.</p>
<p>Marisol continues to perform as a vocalist and provides lectures and workshops on health, music, and culture. She looks forward to the 2020 release of her first co-edited book: (Post) Colonial Music Therapy and joining Drexel University's College of Nursing & Health Professions as the Director of Music Therapy & Assistant Clinical Professor Spring 2021.</p>
