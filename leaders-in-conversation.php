        <h2 class="d-inline">Emeritus Professor Judy Atkinson AM</h2>
        <p class="mt-4">Emeritus Professor Judy Atkinson is a Jiman (central west Queensland) and Bundjalung (northern New South Wales) woman, with Anglo-Celtic and German heritage. Her academic contributions to the understanding of trauma related issues stemming from the violence of colonisation and the healing/recovery of Indigenous peoples from such trauma has won her the Carrick Neville Bonner Award in 2006 for her curriculum development and innovative teaching practice. In 2011 she was awarded the Fritz Redlick Memorial Award for Human Rights and Mental Health from the Harvard University program for refugee trauma. Her book ‘Trauma Trails – Recreating Songlines: The transgenerational effects of trauma in Indigenous Australia’, provides context to the life stories of people who have been moved from their country in a process that has created trauma trails, and the changes that can occur in the lives of people as they make connection with each other and share their stories of healing.</p>

In the context of our new COVID world where coping strategies are limited, this passion remains very much alive as she believes music can have an important role in maintaining connectedness, facilitate coping, and create opportunities for mindfulness.</p>

        <p>Vicky has been advocating for music therapy since her first day of graduation, and quite possibly even earlier than that. As the first student to study a Post Graduate degree in Music Therapy in Queensland, there were very limited clinical placements and she had to advocate for new placements. One of these remains a funded position today 27 years later. In addition to this placement, she has established more than 30 positions and created employment for hundreds of clinicians, in the areas of aged care, paediatric care and community music therapy.</p>
        <p>Vicky has been an advocate for music therapy in community, medical and political settings. She grew the Sing & Grow program, taking it from a small program to an ongoing nationally funded program. This required a great deal of advocacy in the early years in both the community and government sector at local, state and federal levels. Sing & Grow continues to provide valuable services to thousands of Australian families twenty years on.</p>
        <p>Vicky is also an advocate for music therapy businesses and is the Founding and Managing Director of Music Beat Australia, a multi-faceted business that provides community music, music early learning, education and therapy programs for children and adults of all abilities to support them to develop every day. She edited a book on the Economics of Therapy with Dan Thomas, and continues to work with creative arts therapists to help them develop and grow their own businesses.</p>
        <p>Vicky is an internationally regarded researcher, presenter and speaker. She has presented many papers, including keynote and invited presentations, at a number of national and international conferences and events. She has achieved international recognition for her clinical work and research in the area of music therapy parent-child intervention and the impact of music early learning on family health and well-being.</p>
