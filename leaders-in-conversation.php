        <h2 class="d-inline">Emeritus Professor Judy Atkinson AM</h2>
        <p class="mt-4">Emeritus Professor Judy Atkinson is a Jiman (central west Queensland) and Bundjalung (northern New South Wales) woman, with Anglo-Celtic and German heritage. Her academic contributions to the understanding of trauma related issues stemming from the violence of colonisation and the healing/recovery of Indigenous peoples from such trauma has won her the Carrick Neville Bonner Award in 2006 for her curriculum development and innovative teaching practice. In 2011 she was awarded the Fritz Redlick Memorial Award for Human Rights and Mental Health from the Harvard University program for refugee trauma. Her book ‘Trauma Trails – Recreating Songlines: The transgenerational effects of trauma in Indigenous Australia’, provides context to the life stories of people who have been moved from their country in a process that has created trauma trails, and the changes that can occur in the lives of people as they make connection with each other and share their stories of healing.</p>

        <h2 class="d-inline">Priscilla Pek</h2>
        <p class="mt-4">Priscilla Pek (MMthpy, B Arts Hons.) is a Melbourne-based Registered Music Therapist who has worked at Monash Children’s Hospital, Monash Health since 2012. She has extensive experience working within the acute medical model in public health, having started as a new graduate in General Paediatrics. Priscilla is currently working full-time, predominantly across Adolescent Medicine (Eating Disorders) and Paediatric Oncology. Over the years she has had the privilege to be involved in service expansion at Monash Health, and has most recently implemented a new inpatient Music Therapy service for Early in Life Mental Health (ELMHS) in partnership with the Monash Children’s Hospital School (MCHS). The ELMHS service consists of two units; ‘Oasis’ provides specialist care to primary school aged children with complex psychiatric and neurodevelopmental needs, while ‘Stepping Stones’ is an adolescent mental health inpatient unit. Alongside clinical work, Priscilla has been involved in a number of portfolios and committees at Monash Health, including Allied Health Ward Governance, Education Portfolio, and EMR (Electronic Medical Record) Portfolio. She has also previously worked with Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) at Austin Health, and worked in research at the University of Melbourne investigating music for wellbeing in schools and the sustainability of these programs and initiatives. Priscilla is passionate about the use of music to improve the coping and health outcomes of young people experiencing medical or mental health challenges. In the context of our new COVID world where coping strategies are limited, this passion remains very much alive as she believes music can have an important role in maintaining connectedness, facilitate coping, and create opportunities for mindfulness.</p>
