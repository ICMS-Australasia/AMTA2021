      about: `
      When working in the adult disability field, the needs and goals of our clients can differ widely across our client base.  It can be a bit of a minefield to perfect the balance of our clients’ own musical goals, functional outcomes that need to be reported to funding bodies, and our own creativity and skills as therapists.  But!!!  When working in the community space, we are only limited by our own creativity and the creativity of our clients. <br><br>
      This workshop will practically explore some different and creative ways to work with adults with disabilities through a music therapy program.  It will touch on group and individual programs, different interventions, and a variety of creative forms of self-expression that enable adults with disabilities to reach their own personal goals.`,

      about: `Generally, in most music therapy practices, conventional heath domain areas such as physical, cognitive, social, and speech are the therapist’s primary clinical focus. Hence, music is then used as a means for a non-musical end, and therefore goal plans, reports, as well as our identity as a discipline are guided by conventional domains rather than music domains. This presentation will introduce the idea of music as a domain area of health in which it is viewed (and heard) as a means to its own end and clinical goals and health are understood musically.`,

      about: `
      In the ever-changing landscape of disability, and with continuous changes to the NDIS, it is vital that information communicated by the AMTA is current and accurate. <br><br>
      As part of the AMTA’s Advocacy Plan, the Disability Working Group is revising and improving AMTA’s resources on music therapy in the NDIS. This is an ongoing process intended to provide AMTA members and other stakeholders with up-to-date information about music therapy and disability. <br><br>
      During this panel/workshop we will outline the AMTA's Advocacy Plan for further strengthening the position of the music therapy profession in the NDIS.  We will examine and seek critique on the relevance of current AMTA NDIS resources and their effectiveness in supporting members working in the Scheme.  We will also examine and seek critique on the relevance of our existing resources and information that is intended for key stakeholders other than AMTA members e.g., NDIA staff who approve music therapy in NDIS plans, NDIS participants, and other NDIS providers.  We are also eager to discuss ideas regarding the best pathways for dissemination of this information, as well as learning more about common challenges experienced by RMTs working in the sector.  A key feature of the AMTA Advocacy Plan is the engagement and involvement of all RMTs who work in the NDIS.  We believe this panel discussion/workshop is an important way for us all to come together and strengthen the position of music therapy in the NDIS now and into the future.
